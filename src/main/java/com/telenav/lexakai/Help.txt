From lexis (greek for word) and kai (hawaiian for ocean).

[wrap]Creates documentation indexes and UML diagrams from the source code of each maven or gradle
project discovered recursively from the root folder(s) given as argument(s).[end]

BASIC PACKAGE DIAGRAMS

[wrap]Lexakai automatically creates basic package diagrams with all public types without further
configuration.[end]

CUSTOM DIAGRAMS

To create a set of one or more custom diagrams for a project, annotations can be used from this project:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.telenav.lexakai</groupId>
        <artifactId>com.telenav.lexakai-annotations</artifactId>
        <version>${project-version}</version>
    </dependency>

[wrap]A class, annotation, enum or interface annotated with @UmlClassDiagram(diagram = [marker-interface].class),
where [marker-interface] extends the interface UmlDiagramIdentifier, will be included in the specified
diagram. For example, a type annotated with:[end]

    @UmlClassDiagram(diagram = DiagramMapServer.class)

[wrap]will be included in the diagram 'diagram-map-server' (the lowercase, hyphenated name derived from
the marker interface name). A type can be used in more than one diagram, by specifying more than one
@UmlClassDiagram annotation[end]:

    @UmlClassDiagram(diagram = DiagramMapServer.class)
    @UmlClassDiagram(diagram = DiagramServers.class)

[wrap]The preferred location for diagram marker interfaces is in the sub-package project.lexakai.diagrams
and they should be prefixed with Diagram to make their use clear.[end]

GROUPING METHODS

[wrap]Groups of methods can be specified using the @UmlMethodGroup annotation. Method groups will
be given labeled separators in class diagrams, making the list of methods easier to understand.
For example:[end]

    @UmlMethodGroup("configuration")

[wrap]could be used to label all the configuration-related methods in a type. Multiple @UmlMethodGroup
annotations can be added to specify that a method should be shown in more than one group.[end]

AUTOMATIC METHOD GROUPS

[wrap]The @UmlMethodGroup annotation can be avoided if the switch -automatic-method-groups is set to true
(which is the default).  In this case, the best guess will be made based on method name and parameter
patterns as to which group a method most likely belongs. When the guess is inaccurate, or no guess is made,
an @UmlMethodGroup annotation can be applied to correct the result. The set of patterns that are used to
determine automatic groups is in a file called 'lexakai.groups' in the documentation folder.[end]

UML ASSOCIATIONS

[wrap]Patterns in the names of types, fields and methods are used to try to deduce UML associations.
The annotation @UmlRelation can be used to override this guess with an explicit relation if the association
was not be deduced or it was deduced incorrectly.[end]

[wrap]If the annotation @UmlRelation(label = \"<label>\") is applied to a method or field, a relation arrow will
be drawn from the enclosing type to the type of the member. Similar annotations are available for field
aggregation (@UmlAggregation) and composition (@UmlComposition). If the @UmlRelation tag is applied to a
type, it can specify a relation with a particular referent and cardinality. An explicit relation of this type
can be made specific to a particular diagram with the 'diagram' parameter. Multiple @UmlRelation tags can
be applied to a type.[end]

EXCLUDING TYPES AND MEMBERS

Methods and fields can be excluded entirely by labeling them with @UmlExcludeMember.

NON-PUBLIC APIS

@UmlNotPublicApi marks a type or member as private even if it is not actually private.

ANNOTATION SUMMARY

    Diagrams:

           @UmlClassDiagram - declares the diagram(s) that the annotated type should be included in
            @UmlMethodGroup - includes the annotated method in a labeled method group in the diagram
                   @UmlNote - adds a callout note to a type or method

    Visibility:

      @UmlExcludeSuperTypes - excludes the listed supertypes from all diagrams
          @UmlExcludeMember - excludes the annotated member
          @UmlIncludeMember - includes the annotated member, even if it wouldn't normally be included
           @UmlNotPublicApi - marks the annotated type or member as private even if it is not

    Associations:

               @UmlRelation - adds a labeled UML relation from the enclosing type to the annotated member type
            @UmlAggregation - adds a UML aggregation association from the enclosing type to the annotated field type
            @UmlComposition - adds a UML composition association from the enclosing type to the annotated field type

CONFIGURATION

The 'documentation' folder for each project should contain a lexakai.properties file that looks similar to this:

    #
    # Project
    #
    project-name         = my-project
    project-description  = This is my project.
    project-javadoc-url  = http://myproject.mypna.com/com.telenav.my.project

    #
    # Diagram Titles
    #
    diagram-my-project   = My Project

[wrap]The diagram name (the lowercase, hyphenated version of the marker interface) is used as a key to locate
the title of the diagram. For example:[end]

    @UmlClassDiagram(diagram = DiagramMapService.class)

refers to the diagram title specified by the key [diagram-map-service] in the lexakai.properties file.

README GENERATION AND UPDATING

[wrap]If the -update-readme switch is set to true (it is false by default to ensure it doesn't overwrite an
existing file) then a README.md file will be generated and updated each time the UML diagrams are generated.
This markdown file will use [project-name] as its title and insert the description [project-description]
from the lexakai.properties file as the project description. An index of project diagrams is updated along with
an index of any javadoc at [project-javadoc-url] for all diagrammed types. Sections of documentation in the
javadoc will also be indexed based on the pattern specified by the switch -javadoc-section-pattern.
By default this pattern is <p><b>[section]</b></p>, which is the style used in the KivaKit.[end]

[wrap]Any text between the markdown comments "start-user-text" and "end-user-text" will be preserved,
allowing additional documentation to be maintained.[end]

CUSTOM README TEMPLATES

[wrap]The first run of Lexakai on a project will create two default templates in the *documentation* folder
one for projects with source code and one for parent projects (projects with sub-projects). These
template files can be modified to produce custom output. To revert to the default templates, simply
remove them and run Lexakai again.[end]
